# hello-world
My 1st repository

Hello everyone, im new to this, so this is my first time using github.
I like node.js,currently im a trainee dev who also is involved in full stack web development,actually
i like both sides of the development but im more into backend, 
but tbh i just program for myself and i do it for fun as a hobbie. 
Currently im performing myself in the Quality Assurance(QA from now on)area,
im in charge of testing and reviewing the performnance and the functionality of various kind of apps and web sites.
As a far as i can i'd like to help with my knowledge in programming to manage in the future a "Testing automation department" in the company i currently work at
